<i><h3>About Me</h3></i>

After transferring from Indiana University, I became extremely involved at the University of Miami.
Initially, I joined the Public Relations Experience Program called PREP. I participated in all
aspects of of developing and executing events to include: operations and logistics, setting up
media facilities, executing press conferences, handling on-site media management, and managing
social (pre, live & post event), disseminating print materials and implementing media relations
tactics. I went to key events such as NASCAR Ford Championship Weekend, Miami Childrens Health
Foundation 2016 Diamond Ball, St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital Its All about the Kids
Gala, and Art Basel Weekend. I accumulated 45 hours of event experience throughout the fall
semester of 2016. I also became involved with The Hurricane, our school newspaper where I wrote
about various events happening in Miami. Now I am involved with WVUM, the school radio. I am
responsible for their PR and work on their blog. I am also a member of <a href="https://dka.org">Delta Kappa Alpha</a> which
