          <h2>Hi!</h2>
          <p>My name is Elyse Waterman. I was born in New Jersey, but frequently relocated for my Dad’s job. While growing up, I moved 11 times between the United States, England and Australia, specifically New Jersey, California, London and Melbourne.</p>

          <p>These adventures shaped me into an extremely adaptable, well-rounded person. Initially, I was very shy, but being able to experience life on three different continents as I navigated my childhood years helped me break out of my shell.</p>

          <p>I am currently a senior at the University of Miami majoring in journalism and minoring in public relations; I am also actively involved in photography and social media.</p>

          <p>I have been privileged enough during my time at the University of Miami to develop my knowledge of communications and deploy it through many of the great programs offered at the university. My <strong>editorial</strong> work has been published in The Miami Hurricane. I have worked <strong>events</strong> with Hurricane Productions. I’ve been a <strong>social media segment host</strong> for UMTV Pulse. I spent three semesters working with the <strong>Public Relations Experience Program</strong> (PREP) handling onsite media management and executing press releases for the South Florida area. I am also a member of the professional cinematic fraternity, <strong>Delta Kappa Alpha</strong>, where I explore my passion for film through various projects and am currently producing a short film titled “Smother.”</p>

          <p>Outside of the University of Miami, I have been able to build <strong>work experience</strong> through with various internships. Last year I completed a <strong>social media internship</strong> at the nonprofit organization Huntington’s Disease Society of America. During the spring of my junior year, I studied abroad in Sydney, Australia, followed by an <strong>online editorial and design internship</strong> in Melbourne with RedBootie, a children’s shoe company.</p>

          <p>Currently I am a <strong>junior editorial intern</strong> at Prism Creative Group, a media outlet that sheds light on Miami’s rich culture and creative community.</p>

          <p>I have deep energy, skill and passion for social and digital platforms. Through this website, you can keep up with my passions and recent projects while I navigate the ins and outs of adulting.</p>

          <p>xx, <br>Elyse</br></p>

          <p></p>
